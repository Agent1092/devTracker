## 🚀 DevTracker (Beta)

DevTracker is a **local-first VS Code extension** that helps developers understand *what they actually worked on* — without cloud sync, spyware, or performance overhead.

### Why DevTracker?
- Developers lose track of daily changes
- Existing tools rely on cloud monitoring or heavy agents
- Offline workflows are ignored

DevTracker fixes this.

## ✨ Features (v0.9.3 — Beta)

- **Instant Diff Viewer**
  - View changes captured by DevTracker snapshots

- **Local History (up to 1 month)**
  - Maintains lightweight local change history

- **Unlimited Local Summaries**
  - Generate summaries locally (no cloud dependency)

✅ Local-first  
✅ Works offline  
✅ No background VMs  
✅ No performance impact  

---

## 🧠 How it works

DevTracker runs a **lightweight embedded local service** inside the extension and stores all data **locally on your machine**.

No data leaves your system.

> Team and business workspace features will be introduced in future versions.
