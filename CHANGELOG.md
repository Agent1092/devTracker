# Changelog

## v0.9.8 — 2026-01-05
### Added
- **Daily Reflection (Auto, Silent)**: “Yesterday at a glance” startup insight

- **Weekly Reflection Dashboard**: global overview across recent work
- **Monthly Reflection Dashboard**: global overview across recent work
- Activity Bar Home actions for Weekly/Monthly exports
- Status bar snapshot counter for current session visibility

### Improved
- History + reflection UI readability (chips/cards + skimmable layout)
- Safer UX separation: bulk revert limited to Local scope only
- General stability around startup/session reporting

### Fixed
- ES2020 compatibility issues (removed String.replaceAll usage)
- Minor UX inconsistencies in summaries and rendering

### Notes
DevTracker remains **local-first**, **offline**, and **privacy-focused**.
Nothing is uploaded. No cloud sync in free version.
